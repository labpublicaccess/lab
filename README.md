# MapReduce Computing Average, Minimum, and Maximum Recorded Temperature by Year

## Input Data

Create a file named `input3_2.txt` and paste the following content:

```plaintext
2014 44
2013 42
2012 30
2013 44
2010 45
2014 38
2011 42
2010 44
```

## Creating Input File

To create the input file, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo gedit input3_2.txt
```

Paste the above content into the text editor and save the file.

## Mapper

Create a file named `mapper3_2.py` and paste the following Python code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
    year, temperature = line.strip().split()
    print(f'{year}\t{temperature}')
```

### Mapper Explanation

The Mapper reads input lines, extracts year and temperature information, and outputs key-value pairs in the format `year   temperature`. This format is necessary for grouping temperatures by year during the MapReduce process.

## Reducer

Create a file named `reducer3_2.py` and paste the following Python code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys

current_year = None
total_temperature = 0
count = 0
min_temperature = float('inf')
max_temperature = float('-inf')

for line in sys.stdin:
    key, value = line.strip().split('\t')
    year = key
    temperature = int(value)

    total_temperature += temperature
    count += 1
    min_temperature = min(min_temperature, temperature)
    max_temperature = max(max_temperature, temperature)

if current_year:
    average_temperature = total_temperature / count
    print(f'{current_year}\t{average_temperature}\t{min_temperature}\t{max_temperature}')
```

### Reducer Explanation

The Reducer processes the key-value pairs emitted by the Mapper. It accumulates the total temperature, counts the number of records, and tracks the minimum and maximum temperatures for each year. The output is in the format `year   average_temperature   min_temperature   max_temperature`.

## Testing

To check if the Mapper and Reducer are working, use the following commands:

```bash
cat input3_2.txt | python3 mapper3_2.py
cat input3_2.txt | python3 mapper3_2.py | sort | python3 reducer3_2.py
```

This should output the average, minimum, and maximum recorded temperatures by year.
